**Zaman Perang** is a 2D base defense strategy game built using the Unity Game Development Environment. Inspired by classic games like "Age of War" and "The Battle Cats," our goal is to create a simple and enjoyable game that educates players about Singapore's history. By incorporating a retro style, we hope to evoke a sense of nostalgia, making the learning experience both engaging and memorable.
