### Motivation
Our passion for blending education with immersive experiences drives the development of **Zaman Perang**. We aim to create an engaging platform where users learn about Singaporean history through interactive gameplay. This approach transforms historical learning into a captivating and enjoyable experience, moving beyond traditional textbook methods.

### Vision
**Zaman Perang** is a 2D base defense strategy game built using the Unity Game Development Environment. Inspired by classic games like "Age of War" and "The Battle Cats," our goal is to create a simple and enjoyable game that educates players about Singapore's history. By incorporating a retro style, we hope to evoke a sense of nostalgia, making the learning experience both engaging and memorable.

### Storyline
**Zaman Perang** takes players through pivotal eras of Singapore's history, from the 12th century to the present and into the future. Each era features unique characters and special moves:

- **Early Settlements Age**: Witness the founding of Singapore by Sang Nila Utama.
- **British Colonial Age**: Experience the transformation into a bustling port city.
- **World War II Age**: Face the challenges of the Japanese occupation.
- **Independence Age**: Guide the nation through its struggle for self-governance.
- **Current & Futuristic Age**: Explore contemporary and future Singapore.

Players can pause to read detailed historical information, deepening their understanding of each era.

### User Stories

- Challenging gameplay that requires strategic thinking.
- Options for difficulty and character development.
- A balanced system where different strategies can lead to victory.
- A game that is easy to pick up and understand.
